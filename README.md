#Capstone project on power bi

Conducted an in-depth analysis of anonymized retail e-commerce data for a leading Portuguese department store to uncover insights on sales, delivery performance, customer satisfaction, and regional trends.

Designed clear and interactive dashboards to visualize KPIs such as top product categories by sales, order delays, payment method usage, customer ratings, and state-wise sales contributions.

Identified and ranked the top 10 best-performing and lowest-performing product categories based on customer review scores to drive potential improvement strategies.

Applied logical data segmentation, categorical comparison, and temporal trend analysis to identify sales patterns, quarterly shifts, and delayed delivery hotspots.

Discovered that over 85% of sales were concentrated in just 5 states, helping identify potential market expansion opportunities in underperforming regions.

Analyzed customer payment behavior, highlighting credit cards as the dominant payment method (75%), informing future promotional targeting.

Detected seasonal sales trends and quarterly fluctuations, supporting inventory planning and campaign timing.

Improved data storytelling using layered visuals such as tables, bar charts, pie charts, and matrices to communicate insights effectively.

Demonstrated strong fundamentals in data analytics logic, insight generation, and transforming raw business data into strategic recommendations.
